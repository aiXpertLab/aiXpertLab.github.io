Godel's  Proof 
Acknowledgments 

The  authors  gratefully  acknowledge  the  generous 
assistance  they  received  from  Professor  John  C.  Cooley 
of  Columbia  University.  He  read  critically  an  early 
draft  of  the  manuscript,  and  helped  to  clarify  the  struc- 
ture of  the  argument  and  to  improve  the  exposition  of 
points  in  logic.  We  wish  to  thank  Scientific  American 
for  permission  to  reproduce  several  of  the  diagrams  in 
the  text,  which  appeared  in  an  article  on  Godel's  Proof 
in  the  June  1956  issue  of  the  magazine.  We  are  in- 
debted to  Professor  Morris  Kline  of  New  York  Univer- 
sity for  helpful  suggestions  regarding  the  manuscript. 

Introduction 

In  1931  there  appeared  in  a  German  scientific  peri- 
odical a  relatively  short  paper  with  the  forbidding  title 
Uber  formal  unentscheidbare  Satze  der  Principia 
Mathematica  und  verwandter  Systeme  (On  Formally 
Undecidable  Propositions  of  Principia  Mathematica 
and  Related  Systems).  Its  author  was  Kurt  Godel, 
then  a  young  mathematician  of  25  at  the  University  of 
Vienna  and  since  1938  a  permanent  member  of  the  In- 
stitute for  Advanced  Study  at  Princeton.  The  paper  is 
a  milestone  in  the  history  of  logic  and  mathematics. 
When  Harvard  University  awarded  Godel  an  honor- 
ary degree  in  1952,  the  citation  described  the  work  as 
one  of  the  most  important  advances  in  logic  in  modern 
times. 

At  the  time  of  its  appearance,  however,  neither  the 
title  of  Godel's  paper  nor  its  content  was  intelligible  to 
most  mathematicians.  The  Principia  Mathematica 
mentioned  in  the  title  is  the  monumental  three-vol- 
ume treatise  by  Alfred  North  Whitehead  and  Bertrand 
Russell  on  mathematical  logic  and  the  foundations  of
